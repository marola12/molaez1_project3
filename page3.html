        <h2>My Hobby</h2>
        
        <p>My favorite hobby is swimming. I really love to swim, especially in a pool and at the lake.</p>
        <p>Apart from swimming myself, I love to watch the Olympics, as it inspires me to swim and improve my techniques and skills.</p>
        <p>My favorite swimmer is Katie Ledecky, who is from the United States, has broken multiple records, and consistently breaks her own world records.</p>

        <p>I learned to swim when I was eleven years old, and learned faster than I expected myself to (especially as I get scared very easily).</p>
        <p>During the summer, I love to jump into the pool and enjoy the warm sun as soon as the weather gets really warm. I love to sit by the pool with my family and jump into the pool from the evening until the end of the night.</p>
